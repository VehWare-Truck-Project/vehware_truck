

when the .py code is moved from the student linux machine to my windows machine, pycharm complains about the indents not being correct.

to fix that go to a winows terminal window and type out the .py file!
then copy the code
then go to pycharm project lk_front.py or whatever one and delete the code in pycram and paste in the copied code from the 
terminal window. This will fix the indents!!
